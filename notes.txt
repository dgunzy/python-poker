ok so what i'll have you do is rank all the dealt pat badugis from 1 to whatever number the bottom is, but with a few parameters

we already know the player has a pat badugi so we can actually ignore the suits because we are only looking at the portion of range that is also a badugi

which means we also ignore all hands with a pair in them

then the further constraints are as follows: If the hand has a King, it must also have 3 cards 8 and lower (Ace counts as low)

if the hand has a queen , it must either have 3 cards 8 and lower, or a nine with two cards 5 and lower

all other dealt badugis count

so JT98 is ok , as is Q876 as is Q954 , but Q973 and K93A would not be eligible

then I would want your output to group all the combinations by their highest card

IE there is just one combination of a "4" - 432A

then there are 4 combinations of 5 : 532A, 542A, 543A, 5432

and so on

ace is always low

lmk if you need clarification on any of it

and ultimately i'd want to be able to access both the list of badugis, as well as have access to the # of combos of each "top card"

BADUGI RULES

- lowest 4 card hard
- three draws
- A - 4 worst and winning hand
- Suits count, if you dont have 4 different you auto lose to a badugi
- THen its ranked by cards, a 8s5s4c3d hand is a 3 card hand
